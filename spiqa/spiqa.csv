The figure shows two tables. The top table is the original SMD Navigate data, and the bottom table is the pre-processed data.

handle such changes. We propose an encoder-decoder architecture (BoSsNet) with
a novel Bag-of-Sequences (BoSs) memory, which facilitates the disentangled
learning of the response's language model and its knowledge incorporation.
Consequently, the KB can be modified with new knowledge without a drop in
interpretability. We find that BoSsNet outperforms state-of-the-art models,
with considerable improvements (> 10\%) on bAbI OOV test sets and other
human-human datasets. We also systematically modify existing datasets to
measure disentanglement and show BoSsNet to be robust to KB modifications.",Figure 9: Pre-processing of SMD Navigate data used in Mem2Seq paper

the optimization of cross-entropy loss (CELoss). Then the quality of detected
saliency maps is often evaluated in terms of F-measure. In this paper, we
investigate an interesting issue: can we consistently use the F-measure
formulation in both training and evaluation for SOD? By reformulating the
standard F-measure we propose the relaxed F-measure which is differentiable
w.r.t the posterior and can be easily appended to the back of CNNs as the loss
function. Compared to the conventional cross-entropy loss of which the
gradients decrease dramatically in the saturated area, our loss function, named
FLoss, holds considerable gradients even when the activation approaches the
target. Consequently, the FLoss can continuously force the network to produce
polarized activations. Comprehensive benchmarks on several popular datasets
show that FLoss outperforms the state-of-the-art with a considerable margin.
More specifically, due to the polarized predictions, our method is able to
obtain high-quality saliency maps without carefully tuning the optimal
threshold, showing significant advantages in real-world applications.","Precision, Recall, F-measure of model trained under different β2 (Eq. 1). The precision decreases with the growing of β2 whereas recall increases. This characteristic gives us much flexibility to adjust the balance between recall and precision: use larger β2 in a recall-first application and lower β2 otherwise."

tasks. While adversarial training successfully yields generative models for a
variety of areas, temporal relationships in the generated data are much less
explored. Natural temporal changes are crucial for sequential generation tasks,
e.g. video super-resolution and unpaired video translation. For the former,
state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as $L^2$ over
adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads to
temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For
unpaired video translation, existing approaches modify the generator networks

temporally coherent solutions without sacrificing spatial detail. We also

differences, most existing studies separate the estimation of click bias

Figure type: Schematic",1704.07121v2-Figure1-1.png,Being Negative but Constructively: Lessons Learnt from Creating Better Visual Question Answering Datasets,"Visual question answering (Visual QA) has attracted a lot of attention
lately, seen essentially as a form of (visual) Turing test that artificial
intelligence should strive to achieve. In this paper, we study a crucial
component of this task: how can we design good datasets for the task? We focus
on the design of multiple-choice based datasets where the learner has to select
the right answer from a set of candidate ones including the target (\ie the
correct one) and the decoys (\ie the incorrect ones). Through careful analysis
of the results attained by state-of-the-art learning models and human
annotators on existing datasets, we show that the design of the decoy answers
has a significant impact on how and what the learning models learn from the
datasets. In particular, the resulting learner can ignore the visual
information, the question, or both while still doing well on the task. Inspired
by this, we propose automatic procedures to remedy such design deficiencies. We
apply the procedures to re-construct decoy answers for two popular Visual QA
datasets as well as to create a new Visual QA dataset from the Visual Genome
project, resulting in the largest dataset for this task. Extensive empirical
studies show that the design deficiencies have been alleviated in the remedied
datasets and the performance on them is likely a more faithful indicator of the
difference among learning models. The datasets are released and publicly
available via http://www.teds.usc.edu/website_vqa/.","Figure 1: An illustration of how the shortcuts in the Visual7W dataset (Zhu et al., 2016) should be remedied. In the original dataset, the correct answer “A train” is easily selected by a machine as it is far often used as the correct answer than the other decoy (negative) answers. (The numbers in the brackets are probability scores computed using eq. (2)). Our two procedures — QoU and IoU (cf. Sect. 4) — create alternative decoys such that both the correct answer and the decoys are highly likely by examining either the image or the question alone. In these cases, machines make mistakes unless they consider all information together. Thus, the alternative decoys suggested our procedures are better designed to gauge how well a learning algorithm can understand all information equally well."

present an inference method for neural networks that enforces deterministic

we enforce constraints with gradient-based inference (GBI): for each input at

in sequence-to-sequence syntactic parsing, we require that the sequential
outputs encode valid trees. While hidden units might capture such properties,
the network is not always able to learn such constraints from the training data
alone, and practitioners must then resort to post-processing. In this paper, we
present an inference method for neural networks that enforces deterministic
constraints on outputs without performing rule-based post-processing or
expensive discrete search. Instead, in the spirit of gradient-based training,
we enforce constraints with gradient-based inference (GBI): for each input at
test-time, we nudge continuous model weights until the network's unconstrained
inference procedure generates an output that satisfies the constraints. We
study the efficacy of GBI on three tasks with hard constraints: semantic role
labeling, syntactic parsing, and sequence transduction. In each case, the
algorithm not only satisfies constraints but improves accuracy, even when the
underlying network is state-of-the-art.","Table 1: Comparison of the GBI vs. A*inference procedure for SRL.

Redundancy: Reattention increases the KL divergence between adjacent attention blocks, indicating that the attention distributions across blocks become more distinct and less redundant.
Deficiency: Reattention reduces the KL divergence between the normalized attention distribution ($E^t$) and the ideal uniform distribution (${E^t}^*$), suggesting that the attention becomes more balanced and closer to the desired distribution.

  In this paper, we study the much more challenging problem of crafting
adversarial examples for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, whose inputs
are discrete text strings and outputs have an almost infinite number of
possibilities. To address the challenges caused by the discrete input space, we
propose a projected gradient method combined with group lasso and gradient
regularization. To handle the almost infinite output space, we design some
novel loss functions to conduct non-overlapping attack and targeted keyword
attack. We apply our algorithm to machine translation and text summarization
tasks, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm: by changing less
than 3 words, we can make seq2seq model to produce desired outputs with high
success rates. On the other hand, we recognize that, compared with the
well-evaluated CNN-based classifiers, seq2seq models are intrinsically more
robust to adversarial attacks.","Table 4: Results of targeted keywords attack in text summarization. |K| is the number of keywords.

three losses to consider spatial, appearance, and adversarial information. The
spatial loss determines whether the locations of predicted parts are correct.
Input patches are restored in the output image without much modification due to
the appearance loss. The adversarial loss ensures output images are realistic.

their pairwise similarities. We then propose an efficient algorithm that solves
a non-convex and NP-hard problem to learn new features based on the

framework that consists of two phases: Bottom-up part learning and top-down
model composition. Our framework integrates the foreground-background
segmentation problem into the structure learning task via a background model.
As a result, we can jointly optimize for the number of layers in the hierarchy,
the number of parts per layer and a foreground-background segmentation based on
class labels only. We show that the learned HCMs are semantically meaningful

zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), which uses privileged information from

target-domain representation. Therefore, the source-domain task of interest
solution (e.g. a classifier for classification tasks) which is jointly trained
with the source-domain representation can be applicable to both the source and
target representations. Using the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, NIST, EMNIST, and SUN

interpretability. As a result, the following open challenges remain: a) various
modeling constraints, such as temporal smoothness, sparsity and non-negativity,
are needed to be imposed for interpretable temporal modeling and b) a scalable

its model factors are usually dense and sensitive to noise which limits their
interpretability. As a result, the following open challenges remain: a) various
modeling constraints, such as temporal smoothness, sparsity and non-negativity,
are needed to be imposed for interpretable temporal modeling and b) a scalable
approach is required to support those constraints efficiently for large

significant speedups (up to 36 times faster) over prior PARAFAC2 approaches

tasks and must adapt to the home environment and preferences of their user.
Learning from demonstration is a promising choice, that would allow the
non-technical user to teach the robot different tasks. However, collecting
demonstrations in the home environment of a disabled user is time consuming,
disruptive to the comfort of the user, and presents safety challenges. It would
be desirable to perform the demonstrations in a virtual environment. In this
paper we describe a solution to the challenging problem of behavior transfer
from virtual demonstration to a physical robot. The virtual demonstrations are
used to train a deep neural network based controller, which is using a Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to generate trajectories. The
training process uses a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to calculate an error
signal suitable for the multimodal nature of demonstrations. The controller
learned in the virtual environment is transferred to a physical robot (a
Rethink Robotics Baxter). An off-the-shelf vision component is used to
substitute for geometric knowledge available in the simulation and an inverse
kinematics module is used to allow the Baxter to enact the trajectory. Our

controller learned from virtual demonstrations can be used to successfully
perform the manipulation tasks on a physical robot, (2) the LSTM+MDN
architectural choice outperforms other choices, such as the use of feedforward

Earth-Mover) distance is restrictive such that WGANs cannot always fit data
geometry well; (ii) It is difficult to achieve fast training of WGANs. In this
paper, we propose a new class of \textit{Relaxed Wasserstein} (RW) distances by
generalizing Wasserstein-1 distance with Bregman cost functions. We show that
RW distances achieve nice statistical properties while not sacrificing the
computational tractability. Combined with the GANs framework, we develop
Relaxed WGANs (RWGANs) which are not only statistically flexible but can be
approximated efficiently using heuristic approaches. Experiments on real images
demonstrate that the RWGAN with Kullback-Leibler (KL) cost function outperforms
other competing approaches, e.g., WGANs, even with gradient penalty.",Training curves by running all approaches. Generator and discriminator losses are plotted in orange and blue lines. mnist fashion-mnist

well-being, such as long-term improvement, stagnation, and decline in a
variable of interest. We demonstrate that even in a one-step feedback model,
common fairness criteria in general do not promote improvement over time, and
may in fact cause harm in cases where an unconstrained objective would not.

algorithm captures these complex phenomena in two stages: a first neural
network computes a weighting function for a set of pre-computed deformations,
while a second network directly generates a deformation field for refining the
surface. Key for successful training runs in this setting is a suitable loss
function that encodes the effect of the deformations, and a robust calculation
of the corresponding gradients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, we showcase our method with several complex examples of flowing

This problem has many important applications in commercial and scientific
fields such as record matching and domain search. Existing solution relies on
the asymmetric LSH method by transforming the containment similarity to
well-studied Jaccard similarity. In this paper, we use a different framework by
transforming the containment similarity to set intersection. We propose a novel

achieve a good trade-off between the sketch size and the accuracy. We provide a
set of theoretical analysis to underpin the proposed augmented KMV sketch
technique, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art technique LSH-E in

GB-KMV is over 100 times faster than LSH-E on some real-life dataset.","A four-record dataset and a query Q; C(Q,Xi) is the containment similarity of Q in Xi"

high-order, i.e., they have more than two arguments and inducing type
signatures of all arguments is necessary. For example, in the sports domain,
inducing a schema win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer, Tournament, Location) is
more informative than inducing just win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer). We
refer to this problem as Higher-order Relation Schema Induction (HRSI). In this

tasks and must adapt to the home environment and preferences of their user.
Learning from demonstration is a promising choice, that would allow the
non-technical user to teach the robot different tasks. However, collecting
demonstrations in the home environment of a disabled user is time consuming,
disruptive to the comfort of the user, and presents safety challenges. It would
be desirable to perform the demonstrations in a virtual environment. In this
paper we describe a solution to the challenging problem of behavior transfer
from virtual demonstration to a physical robot. The virtual demonstrations are
used to train a deep neural network based controller, which is using a Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to generate trajectories. The
training process uses a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to calculate an error
signal suitable for the multimodal nature of demonstrations. The controller
learned in the virtual environment is transferred to a physical robot (a
Rethink Robotics Baxter). An off-the-shelf vision component is used to
substitute for geometric knowledge available in the simulation and an inverse
kinematics module is used to allow the Baxter to enact the trajectory. Our
experimental studies validate the three contributions of the paper: (1) the
controller learned from virtual demonstrations can be used to successfully
perform the manipulation tasks on a physical robot, (2) the LSTM+MDN
architectural choice outperforms other choices, such as the use of feedforward
networks and mean-squared error based training signals and (3) allowing
imperfect demonstrations in the training set also allows the controller to
learn how to correct its manipulation mistakes.","A sequence of images showing the autonomous execution of pick and place in simulation (first row), pick and place in real world (second row), pushing in simulation (third row), and pushing in real world (fourth row).

should be able to encourage an agent to take actions that lead to less frequent
states which may yield higher accumulative future return. However, both knowing
about the future and evaluating the frequentness of states are non-trivial
tasks, especially for deep RL domains, where a state is represented by
high-dimensional image frames. In this paper, we propose a novel informed
exploration framework for deep RL, where we build the capability for an RL
agent to predict over the future transitions and evaluate the frequentness for
the predicted future frames in a meaningful manner. To this end, we train a
deep prediction model to predict future frames given a state-action pair, and a
convolutional autoencoder model to hash over the seen frames. In addition, to
utilize the counts derived from the seen frames to evaluate the frequentness
for the predicted frames, we tackle the challenge of matching the predicted
future frames and their corresponding seen frames at the latent feature level.
In this way, we derive a reliable metric for evaluating the novelty of the
future direction pointed by each action, and hence inform the agent to explore
the least frequent one.","The prediction and reconstruction result for each task domain. For each task, we present 1 set of frames, where the four frames are organized as follows: (1) the ground-truth frame seen by the agent; (2) the predicted frame by the prediction model; (3) the reconstruction of autoencoder trained only with reconstruction loss; (4) the reconstruction of autoencoder trained after the second phase (i.e., trained with both reconstruction loss and code matching loss).

task-relevant target-domain data is available. To tackle this issue, we propose
zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), which uses privileged information from
task-irrelevant dual-domain pairs. ZDDA learns a source-domain representation
which is not only tailored for the task of interest but also close to the
target-domain representation. Therefore, the source-domain task of interest
solution (e.g. a classifier for classification tasks) which is jointly trained
with the source-domain representation can be applicable to both the source and
target representations. Using the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, NIST, EMNIST, and SUN

state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as $L^2$ over
adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads to
temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For

tasks. While adversarial training successfully yields generative models for a
variety of areas, temporal relationships in the generated data are much less
explored. Natural temporal changes are crucial for sequential generation tasks,
e.g. video super-resolution and unpaired video translation. For the former,
state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as $L^2$ over
adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads to
temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For
unpaired video translation, existing approaches modify the generator networks
to form spatio-temporal cycle consistencies. In contrast, we focus on improving
learning objectives and propose a temporally self-supervised algorithm. For
both tasks, we show that temporal adversarial learning is key to achieving
temporally coherent solutions without sacrificing spatial detail. We also
propose a novel Ping-Pong loss to improve the long-term temporal consistency.
It effectively prevents recurrent networks from accumulating artifacts
temporally without depressing detailed features. Additionally, we propose a

tasks. While adversarial training successfully yields generative models for a
variety of areas, temporal relationships in the generated data are much less
explored. Natural temporal changes are crucial for sequential generation tasks,
e.g. video super-resolution and unpaired video translation. For the former,
state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as $L^2$ over
adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads to
temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For
unpaired video translation, existing approaches modify the generator networks
to form spatio-temporal cycle consistencies. In contrast, we focus on improving
learning objectives and propose a temporally self-supervised algorithm. For
both tasks, we show that temporal adversarial learning is key to achieving
temporally coherent solutions without sacrificing spatial detail. We also
propose a novel Ping-Pong loss to improve the long-term temporal consistency.
It effectively prevents recurrent networks from accumulating artifacts
temporally without depressing detailed features. Additionally, we propose a
first set of metrics to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy as well as the
perceptual quality of the temporal evolution. A series of user studies confirm
the rankings computed with these metrics. Code, data, models, and results are

conventional CVR models are trained with samples of clicked impressions while

compared on open benchmarks such as MIT300 and LSUN. However, progress in the
field can be difficult to judge because models are compared using a variety of
inconsistent metrics. Here we show that no single saliency map can perform well
under all metrics. Instead, we propose a principled approach to solve the
benchmarking problem by separating the notions of saliency models, maps and
metrics. Inspired by Bayesian decision theory, we define a saliency model to be
a probabilistic model of fixation density prediction and a saliency map to be a
metric-specific prediction derived from the model density which maximizes the
expected performance on that metric given the model density. We derive these
optimal saliency maps for the most commonly used saliency metrics (AUC, sAUC,
NSS, CC, SIM, KL-Div) and show that they can be computed analytically or
approximated with high precision. We show that this leads to consistent
rankings in all metrics and avoids the penalties of using one saliency map for
all metrics. Our method allows researchers to have their model compete on many
different metrics with state-of-the-art in those metrics: ""good"" models will
perform well in all metrics.","Predicting optimal saliency maps for the CC metric: Starting from a density (a) we sampled 100000 sets of either 1, 10 or 100 fixations and used them to create empirical saliency maps. Using these empirical saliency maps, we calculated the mean empirical saliency map (shown for 10 fixations per empirical saliency map in (b)). Additionally, we normalized the empirical saliency maps to have zero mean and unit variance to compute the mean normalized empirical saliency map (c) which is optimal with respect to the CC metric. Then we sampled another 100000 empirical saliency maps from the original density and evaluated CC scores of the mean empirical and mean normalized empirical saliency maps (d). The mean normalized saliency map yields slighly higher scores in all cases but the difference to the mean empirical saliency map is tiny, indicating that the expected empirical saliency map is a very good approximation of the optimal saliency map for the CC metric."

present an inference method for neural networks that enforces deterministic
constraints on outputs without performing rule-based post-processing or
expensive discrete search. Instead, in the spirit of gradient-based training,
we enforce constraints with gradient-based inference (GBI): for each input at
test-time, we nudge continuous model weights until the network's unconstrained
inference procedure generates an output that satisfies the constraints. We

model of an object from a set of images which show examples of the object in

problem are limited by making strong a-priori assumptions about the object's
geometric structure and require segmented training data for learning. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for learning hierarchical compositional
models (HCMs) which do not suffer from the mentioned limitations. We present a
generalized formulation of HCMs and describe a greedy structure learning
framework that consists of two phases: Bottom-up part learning and top-down
model composition. Our framework integrates the foreground-background
segmentation problem into the structure learning task via a background model.
As a result, we can jointly optimize for the number of layers in the hierarchy,
the number of parts per layer and a foreground-background segmentation based on
class labels only. We show that the learned HCMs are semantically meaningful
and achieve competitive results when compared to other generative object models
at object classification on a standard transfer learning dataset.","The dependence structure between random variables in a Compositional Active Basis Model.

this area have focused only on binary RSI, i.e., inducing only the subject and

high-order, i.e., they have more than two arguments and inducing type
signatures of all arguments is necessary. For example, in the sports domain,
inducing a schema win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer, Tournament, Location) is
more informative than inducing just win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer). We
refer to this problem as Higher-order Relation Schema Induction (HRSI). In this

novel framework for the HRSI problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the

tasks and must adapt to the home environment and preferences of their user.
Learning from demonstration is a promising choice, that would allow the
non-technical user to teach the robot different tasks. However, collecting
demonstrations in the home environment of a disabled user is time consuming,
disruptive to the comfort of the user, and presents safety challenges. It would
be desirable to perform the demonstrations in a virtual environment. In this
paper we describe a solution to the challenging problem of behavior transfer
from virtual demonstration to a physical robot. The virtual demonstrations are
used to train a deep neural network based controller, which is using a Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to generate trajectories. The
training process uses a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to calculate an error
signal suitable for the multimodal nature of demonstrations. The controller
learned in the virtual environment is transferred to a physical robot (a
Rethink Robotics Baxter). An off-the-shelf vision component is used to
substitute for geometric knowledge available in the simulation and an inverse
kinematics module is used to allow the Baxter to enact the trajectory. Our
experimental studies validate the three contributions of the paper: (1) the
controller learned from virtual demonstrations can be used to successfully
perform the manipulation tasks on a physical robot, (2) the LSTM+MDN
architectural choice outperforms other choices, such as the use of feedforward
networks and mean-squared error based training signals and (3) allowing
imperfect demonstrations in the training set also allows the controller to
learn how to correct its manipulation mistakes.","Figure 3: The training and evaluation phase. During the training the LSTM network is unrolled for 50 time-steps.

e.g. video super-resolution and unpaired video translation. For the former,
state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as $L^2$ over
adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads to
temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For
unpaired video translation, existing approaches modify the generator networks

Our framework trains the primary segmentation model with the aid of an
ancillary model that generates initial segmentation labels for the weak set and
a self-correction module that improves the generated labels during training
using the increasingly accurate primary model. We introduce two variants of the
self-correction module using either linear or convolutional functions.

trained with a small fully supervised set perform similar to, or better than,
models trained with a large fully supervised set while requiring ~7x less

This model generates an initial segmentation for the weak set, which will aid training the primary model. iii) Self-correction module refines segmentations generated by the ancillary model and the current primary model for the weak set.

zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), which uses privileged information from

with the source-domain representation can be applicable to both the source and
target representations. Using the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, NIST, EMNIST, and SUN

be desirable to perform the demonstrations in a virtual environment. In this

training process uses a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to calculate an error
signal suitable for the multimodal nature of demonstrations. The controller
learned in the virtual environment is transferred to a physical robot (a

substitute for geometric knowledge available in the simulation and an inverse
kinematics module is used to allow the Baxter to enact the trajectory. Our

controller learned from virtual demonstrations can be used to successfully
perform the manipulation tasks on a physical robot, (2) the LSTM+MDN

treatments across a set of patients with the varying number of medical

its model factors are usually dense and sensitive to noise which limits their
interpretability. As a result, the following open challenges remain: a) various
modeling constraints, such as temporal smoothness, sparsity and non-negativity,
are needed to be imposed for interpretable temporal modeling and b) a scalable
approach is required to support those constraints efficiently for large
datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a {\it CO}nstrained {\it

such as temporal smoothness, sparsity, and non-negativity in the resulting
factors. To efficiently support all those constraints, COPA adopts a hybrid

significant speedups (up to 36 times faster) over prior PARAFAC2 approaches

treatments across a set of patients with the varying number of medical
encounters over time. Despite recent improvements on unconstrained PARAFAC2,
its model factors are usually dense and sensitive to noise which limits their
interpretability. As a result, the following open challenges remain: a) various
modeling constraints, such as temporal smoothness, sparsity and non-negativity,
are needed to be imposed for interpretable temporal modeling and b) a scalable
approach is required to support those constraints efficiently for large
datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a {\it CO}nstrained {\it
PA}RAFAC2 (COPA) method, which carefully incorporates optimization constraints
such as temporal smoothness, sparsity, and non-negativity in the resulting
factors. To efficiently support all those constraints, COPA adopts a hybrid
optimization framework using alternating optimization and alternating direction

(EHR) datasets with hundreds of thousands of patients, COPA achieves
significant speedups (up to 36 times faster) over prior PARAFAC2 approaches

Overall, our method outperforms all the baselines attempting to handle a subset
of the constraints in terms of speed, while achieving the same level of

of methods has been explored to debias click data for learning to rank such as
click models, result interleaving and, more recently, the unbiased
learning-to-rank framework based on inverse propensity weighting. Despite their
differences, most existing studies separate the estimation of click bias
(namely the \textit{propensity model}) from the learning of ranking algorithms.
To estimate click propensities, they either conduct online result
randomization, which can negatively affect the user experience, or offline
parameter estimation, which has special requirements for click data and is
optimized for objectives (e.g. click likelihood) that are not directly related
to the ranking performance of the system. In this work, we address those
problems by unifying the learning of propensity models and ranking models. We
find that the problem of estimating a propensity model from click data is a
dual problem of unbiased learning to rank. Based on this observation, we
propose a Dual Learning Algorithm (DLA) that jointly learns an unbiased ranker
and an \textit{unbiased propensity model}. DLA is an automatic unbiased
learning-to-rank framework as it directly learns unbiased ranking models from
biased click data without any preprocessing. It can adapt to the change of bias
distributions and is applicable to online learning. Our empirical experiments

with respect to Q is |Q intersect X|/ |Q|. Given a query record Q and a set of
records S, the containment similarity search finds a set of records from S
whose containment similarity regarding Q are not less than the given threshold.
This problem has many important applications in commercial and scientific
fields such as record matching and domain search. Existing solution relies on
the asymmetric LSH method by transforming the containment similarity to
well-studied Jaccard similarity. In this paper, we use a different framework by
transforming the containment similarity to set intersection. We propose a novel
augmented KMV sketch technique, namely GB-KMV, which is data-dependent and can
achieve a good trade-off between the sketch size and the accuracy. We provide a
set of theoretical analysis to underpin the proposed augmented KMV sketch
technique, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art technique LSH-E in
terms of estimation accuracy under practical assumption. Our comprehensive
experiments on real-life datasets verify that GB-KMV is superior to LSH-E in
terms of the space-accuracy trade-off, time-accuracy trade-off, and the sketch

tensor dimensions vary across one of the modes. An example scenario is modeling
treatments across a set of patients with the varying number of medical
encounters over time. Despite recent improvements on unconstrained PARAFAC2,
its model factors are usually dense and sensitive to noise which limits their
interpretability. As a result, the following open challenges remain: a) various
modeling constraints, such as temporal smoothness, sparsity and non-negativity,
are needed to be imposed for interpretable temporal modeling and b) a scalable
approach is required to support those constraints efficiently for large
datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a {\it CO}nstrained {\it
PA}RAFAC2 (COPA) method, which carefully incorporates optimization constraints
such as temporal smoothness, sparsity, and non-negativity in the resulting
factors. To efficiently support all those constraints, COPA adopts a hybrid
optimization framework using alternating optimization and alternating direction

(EHR) datasets with hundreds of thousands of patients, COPA achieves
significant speedups (up to 36 times faster) over prior PARAFAC2 approaches

Overall, our method outperforms all the baselines attempting to handle a subset
of the constraints in terms of speed, while achieving the same level of
accuracy. Through a case study on temporal phenotyping of medically complex

phenotypes and meaningful temporal profiles of patients. The clinical

component of this task: how can we design good datasets for the task? We focus
on the design of multiple-choice based datasets where the learner has to select
the right answer from a set of candidate ones including the target (\ie the
correct one) and the decoys (\ie the incorrect ones). Through careful analysis
of the results attained by state-of-the-art learning models and human

using a deep neural network; (2) Our model can be built upon existing
learning-to-rank methods by directly using their extracted feature vectors; (3)
Our model is trained with an attention-based loss function, which is more

utilize the counts derived from the seen frames to evaluate the frequentness
for the predicted frames, we tackle the challenge of matching the predicted
future frames and their corresponding seen frames at the latent feature level.

specifically targets the space-time representation of physical surfaces from
liquid simulations. Liquids exhibit highly complex, non-linear behavior under
changing simulation conditions such as different initial conditions. Our
algorithm captures these complex phenomena in two stages: a first neural
network computes a weighting function for a set of pre-computed deformations,
while a second network directly generates a deformation field for refining the
surface. Key for successful training runs in this setting is a suitable loss
function that encodes the effect of the deformations, and a robust calculation
of the corresponding gradients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, we showcase our method with several complex examples of flowing
liquids with topology changes. Our representation makes it possible to rapidly
generate the desired implicit surfaces. We have implemented a mobile

present an inference method for neural networks that enforces deterministic
constraints on outputs without performing rule-based post-processing or

we enforce constraints with gradient-based inference (GBI): for each input at

inference procedure generates an output that satisfies the constraints. We
study the efficacy of GBI on three tasks with hard constraints: semantic role

data is essential to building accurate and robust image classifiers. One
standard strategy is to apply data augmentation to synthetically enlarge the
training set. However, data augmentation is essentially a brute-force method
which generates uniform samples from some pre-defined set of transformations.
In this paper, we propose a principled approach to train networks with
significantly improved resistance to large variations between training and
testing data. This is achieved by embedding a learnable transformation module
into the introspective network, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN)
classifier empowered with generative capabilities. Our approach alternates
between synthesizing pseudo-negative samples and transformed positive examples
based on the current model, and optimizing model predictions on these
synthesized samples. Experimental results verify that our approach
significantly improves the ability of deep networks to resist large variations
between training and testing data and achieves classification accuracy

tasks. While adversarial training successfully yields generative models for a
variety of areas, temporal relationships in the generated data are much less
explored. Natural temporal changes are crucial for sequential generation tasks,
e.g. video super-resolution and unpaired video translation. For the former,
state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as $L^2$ over
adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads to
temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For
unpaired video translation, existing approaches modify the generator networks
to form spatio-temporal cycle consistencies. In contrast, we focus on improving
learning objectives and propose a temporally self-supervised algorithm. For
both tasks, we show that temporal adversarial learning is key to achieving
temporally coherent solutions without sacrificing spatial detail. We also
propose a novel Ping-Pong loss to improve the long-term temporal consistency.

constraint propagation module to guarantee the spatial-temporal coherence among
frames, (2) a stochastic sampling process to generate dynamics from the

e.g. video super-resolution and unpaired video translation. For the former,
state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as $L^2$ over
adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads to
temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For
unpaired video translation, existing approaches modify the generator networks

w.r.t the posterior and can be easily appended to the back of CNNs as the loss
function. Compared to the conventional cross-entropy loss of which the
gradients decrease dramatically in the saturated area, our loss function, named
FLoss, holds considerable gradients even when the activation approaches the
target. Consequently, the FLoss can continuously force the network to produce
polarized activations. Comprehensive benchmarks on several popular datasets
show that FLoss outperforms the state-of-the-art with a considerable margin.

treatments across a set of patients with the varying number of medical
encounters over time. Despite recent improvements on unconstrained PARAFAC2,
its model factors are usually dense and sensitive to noise which limits their
interpretability. As a result, the following open challenges remain: a) various
modeling constraints, such as temporal smoothness, sparsity and non-negativity,
are needed to be imposed for interpretable temporal modeling and b) a scalable
approach is required to support those constraints efficiently for large
datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a {\it CO}nstrained {\it

such as temporal smoothness, sparsity, and non-negativity in the resulting
factors. To efficiently support all those constraints, COPA adopts a hybrid

significant speedups (up to 36 times faster) over prior PARAFAC2 approaches

component of this task: how can we design good datasets for the task? We focus
on the design of multiple-choice based datasets where the learner has to select
the right answer from a set of candidate ones including the target (\ie the
correct one) and the decoys (\ie the incorrect ones). Through careful analysis
of the results attained by state-of-the-art learning models and human

A variety
of methods has been explored to debias click data for learning to rank such as
click models, result interleaving and, more recently, the unbiased
learning-to-rank framework based on inverse propensity weighting. Despite their
differences, most existing studies separate the estimation of click bias
(namely the \textit{propensity model}) from the learning of ranking algorithms.
To estimate click propensities, they either conduct online result
randomization, which can negatively affect the user experience, or offline
parameter estimation, which has special requirements for click data and is
optimized for objectives (e.g. click likelihood) that are not directly related
to the ranking performance of the system. In this work, we address those
problems by unifying the learning of propensity models and ranking models. We
find that the problem of estimating a propensity model from click data is a
dual problem of unbiased learning to rank. Based on this observation, we
propose a Dual Learning Algorithm (DLA) that jointly learns an unbiased ranker
and an \textit{unbiased propensity model}. DLA is an automatic unbiased
learning-to-rank framework as it directly learns unbiased ranking models from
biased click data without any preprocessing. It can adapt to the change of bias
distributions and is applicable to online learning. Our empirical experiments

search. Given two records Q and X, the containment similarity between Q and X
with respect to Q is |Q intersect X|/ |Q|. Given a query record Q and a set of
records S, the containment similarity search finds a set of records from S
whose containment similarity regarding Q are not less than the given threshold.
This problem has many important applications in commercial and scientific
fields such as record matching and domain search. Existing solution relies on
the asymmetric LSH method by transforming the containment similarity to
well-studied Jaccard similarity. In this paper, we use a different framework by
transforming the containment similarity to set intersection. We propose a novel
augmented KMV sketch technique, namely GB-KMV, which is data-dependent and can
achieve a good trade-off between the sketch size and the accuracy. We provide a
set of theoretical analysis to underpin the proposed augmented KMV sketch
technique, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art technique LSH-E in
terms of estimation accuracy under practical assumption. Our comprehensive
experiments on real-life datasets verify that GB-KMV is superior to LSH-E in
terms of the space-accuracy trade-off, time-accuracy trade-off, and the sketch
construction time. For instance, with similar estimation accuracy (F-1 score),
GB-KMV is over 100 times faster than LSH-E on some real-life dataset.",EleFreq z-value varying from 0.4 to 1.2 with recSize z-value 1.0; recSize z-value varying from 0.8 to 1.4 with eleFreq z-value 0.8

polarized activations. Comprehensive benchmarks on several popular datasets

state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as $L^2$ over

temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For

lately, seen essentially as a form of (visual) Turing test that artificial
intelligence should strive to achieve. In this paper, we study a crucial
component of this task: how can we design good datasets for the task? We focus
on the design of multiple-choice based datasets where the learner has to select
the right answer from a set of candidate ones including the target (\ie the
correct one) and the decoys (\ie the incorrect ones). Through careful analysis
of the results attained by state-of-the-art learning models and human
annotators on existing datasets, we show that the design of the decoy answers
has a significant impact on how and what the learning models learn from the
datasets. In particular, the resulting learner can ignore the visual
information, the question, or both while still doing well on the task. Inspired
by this, we propose automatic procedures to remedy such design deficiencies. We
apply the procedures to re-construct decoy answers for two popular Visual QA
datasets as well as to create a new Visual QA dataset from the Visual Genome
project, resulting in the largest dataset for this task. Extensive empirical
studies show that the design deficiencies have been alleviated in the remedied
datasets and the performance on them is likely a more faithful indicator of the
difference among learning models. The datasets are released and publicly

attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether the target sample is a member of the

differential privacy and adversarial regularization. Unfortunately, these
defenses produce ML models with unacceptably low classification performances.
Our work proposes a new defense, called distillation for membership privacy
(DMP), against MIAs that preserves the utility of the resulting models
significantly better than prior defenses. DMP leverages knowledge distillation
to train ML models with membership privacy. We provide a novel criterion to
tune the data used for knowledge transfer in order to amplify the membership
privacy of DMP. Our extensive evaluation shows that DMP provides significantly
better tradeoffs between membership privacy and classification accuracies

accuracy improvement over adversarial regularization for DenseNet trained on

gradients decrease dramatically in the saturated area, our loss function, named
FLoss, holds considerable gradients even when the activation approaches the

polarized activations. Comprehensive benchmarks on several popular datasets

systems in industrial applications such as recommendation and advertising.
Conventional CVR modeling applies popular deep learning methods and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. However it encounters several task-specific
problems in practice, making CVR modeling challenging. For example,
conventional CVR models are trained with samples of clicked impressions while
utilized to make inference on the entire space with samples of all impressions.
This causes a sample selection bias problem. Besides, there exists an extreme
data sparsity problem, making the model fitting rather difficult. In this
paper, we model CVR in a brand-new perspective by making good use of sequential
pattern of user actions, i.e., impression -> click -> conversion. The proposed
Entire Space Multi-task Model (ESMM) can eliminate the two problems
simultaneously by i) modeling CVR directly over the entire space, ii) employing
a feature representation transfer learning strategy. Experiments on dataset
gathered from Taobao's recommender system demonstrate that ESMM significantly
outperforms competitive methods. We also release a sampling version of this
dataset to enable future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the

Current approaches assume that task-relevant target-domain data is available

task-relevant target-domain data is available. To tackle this issue, we propose
zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), which uses privileged information from

which is not only tailored for the task of interest but also close to the
target-domain representation. Therefore, the source-domain task of interest
solution (e.g. a classifier for classification tasks) which is jointly trained
with the source-domain representation can be applicable to both the source and
target representations. Using the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, NIST, EMNIST, and SUN
RGB-D datasets, we show that ZDDA can perform domain adaptation in
classification tasks without access to task-relevant target-domain training
data. We also extend ZDDA to perform sensor fusion in the SUN RGB-D scene
classification task by simulating task-relevant target-domain representations
with task-relevant source-domain data. To the best of our knowledge, ZDDA is
the first domain adaptation and sensor fusion method which requires no

important roles in cyber security, social networks, cloud troubleshooting

streams, traditional data structures for graph storage such as the adjacency

graph stream summarization, like CM sketches, gSketches, TCM and gMatrix,
either supports limited kinds of queries or suffers from poor accuracy of query

to summarize the graph streams, which has the linear space cost (O(|E|), E is
the edge set of the graph) and the constant update time complexity (O(1)) and
supports all kinds of queries over graph streams with the controllable errors.

suboptimal for individual queries by ignoring the fact that relevant documents
for different queries may have different distributions in the feature space.
Inspired by the idea of pseudo relevance feedback where top ranked documents,
which we refer as the \textit{local ranking context}, can provide important
information about the query's characteristics, we propose to use the inherent
feature distributions of the top results to learn a Deep Listwise Context Model
that helps us fine tune the initial ranked list. Specifically, we employ a
recurrent neural network to sequentially encode the top results using their
feature vectors, learn a local context model and use it to re-rank the top
results. There are three merits with our model: (1) Our model can capture the
local ranking context based on the complex interactions between top results
using a deep neural network; (2) Our model can be built upon existing
learning-to-rank methods by directly using their extracted feature vectors; (3)
Our model is trained with an attention-based loss function, which is more
effective and efficient than many existing listwise methods. Experimental
results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the
state-of-the-art learning to rank methods on benchmark retrieval corpora.","Figure 2: The NegPair reduction (NP(d,LambdaMART )- NP(d,DLCM)) on documents with different relevance labels."

a probabilistic model of fixation density prediction and a saliency map to be a
metric-specific prediction derived from the model density which maximizes the
expected performance on that metric given the model density. We derive these
optimal saliency maps for the most commonly used saliency metrics (AUC, sAUC,
NSS, CC, SIM, KL-Div) and show that they can be computed analytically or
approximated with high precision. We show that this leads to consistent
rankings in all metrics and avoids the penalties of using one saliency map for

The dots shown in the bottom plot are a subset of the knots used by our cubic spline, and are presented here to demonstrate how this approach allocates spline knots with respect to α."

tasks. While adversarial training successfully yields generative models for a
variety of areas, temporal relationships in the generated data are much less
explored. Natural temporal changes are crucial for sequential generation tasks,
e.g. video super-resolution and unpaired video translation. For the former,
state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as $L^2$ over
adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads to
temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For
unpaired video translation, existing approaches modify the generator networks
to form spatio-temporal cycle consistencies. In contrast, we focus on improving
learning objectives and propose a temporally self-supervised algorithm. For
both tasks, we show that temporal adversarial learning is key to achieving
temporally coherent solutions without sacrificing spatial detail. We also
propose a novel Ping-Pong loss to improve the long-term temporal consistency.
It effectively prevents recurrent networks from accumulating artifacts
temporally without depressing detailed features. Additionally, we propose a
first set of metrics to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy as well as the
perceptual quality of the temporal evolution. A series of user studies confirm

However, the balanced cross-entropy loss requires manually setting weights for positive and negative samples based on their proportion in a mini-batch. This approach might not be optimal for all cases. 

In contrast, FLoss utilizes the F-measure, which inherently balances precision and recall, allowing it to automatically adapt to the data imbalance without requiring predefined weights.

the optimization of cross-entropy loss (CELoss). Then the quality of detected
saliency maps is often evaluated in terms of F-measure. In this paper, we
investigate an interesting issue: can we consistently use the F-measure
formulation in both training and evaluation for SOD? By reformulating the
standard F-measure we propose the relaxed F-measure which is differentiable
w.r.t the posterior and can be easily appended to the back of CNNs as the loss
function. Compared to the conventional cross-entropy loss of which the
gradients decrease dramatically in the saturated area, our loss function, named
FLoss, holds considerable gradients even when the activation approaches the
target. Consequently, the FLoss can continuously force the network to produce
polarized activations. Comprehensive benchmarks on several popular datasets
show that FLoss outperforms the state-of-the-art with a considerable margin.
More specifically, due to the polarized predictions, our method is able to
obtain high-quality saliency maps without carefully tuning the optimal
threshold, showing significant advantages in real-world applications.","Table 4. Performance comparisons across the original cross-entropy loss (Eq. 10), balanced cross-entropy loss (Eq. 15) and our proposed FLoss (Eq. 6). Original cross-entropy learns a biased prior towards the major class (the background). This is evidenced by the low recall: many positive points are mis-predicted as negative because of biased prior. By assigning loss weights on foreground/background samples, the balanced cross-entropy loss can alleviate the unbalancing problem. Our proposed method performs better than the balanced cross-entropy loss, because the F-measure criterion can automatically adjust data unbalance."

training process uses a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to calculate an error
signal suitable for the multimodal nature of demonstrations. The controller
